```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 ..."> <!-- Fallback for browsers without gradient support -->
</div>
```
This improved code includes a fallback.  If the gradient doesn't render correctly, the fallback solid color will be displayed.  You can also use CSS `linear-gradient()` as a fallback within a style tag or external stylesheet for maximum browser compatibility.
