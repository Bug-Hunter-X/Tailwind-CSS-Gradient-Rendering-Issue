```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature.  The issue arises when the gradient doesn't render correctly or displays unexpectedly, especially in older browsers or with specific configurations.  The browser might show a solid color instead of the gradient, or the gradient direction might be wrong.
